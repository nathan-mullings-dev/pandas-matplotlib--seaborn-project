# Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn Workbook | Just IT 

---

## Overview

This repository showcases a hands-on workbook that provides practical experience with data analysis and visualization using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** in **Google Colab**. The workbook is centered around working with GDP per capita data for various countries, allowing me to manipulate, analyze, and visualize economic data using Python.

## Proposal

The goal of this workbook was to equip myself with the necessary tools to handle real-world datasets using Python in a cloud-based environment like **Google Colab**. Throughout this project, I have:
- **Mastered data manipulation techniques** with Pandas, including cleaning and transforming datasets.
- **Developed skills in data visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear, insightful charts and graphs.
- **Analyzed economic data** by working with GDP per capita data across countries, helping to understand economic disparities and trends on a global scale.

I used a publicly available GDP dataset from Kaggle, which provided a solid foundation for understanding how economic indicators fluctuate across different nations and years. By visualizing this data, I learned to identify patterns and trends in global economic development, which are crucial for making informed decisions in economics, business, and policy-making.

## Summary of Work Completed

In this workbook, I:
- **Loaded and cleaned the data** using Pandas, handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Explored GDP per capita trends** across different countries, examining how the data varies over time.
- **Visualized key insights** using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including generating various plots such as line charts, scatter plots, and bar charts to highlight patterns in the data.
- **Investigated economic trends** and compared GDP across countries, helping to understand disparities in wealth and economic development globally.

Key steps and tasks I completed:
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loaded the GDP per capita dataset from Kaggle, performed basic data cleaning, and handled missing values.
2. **Data Exploration**: Used descriptive statistics and Pandas functions to explore the dataset and prepare it for further analysis.
3. **Data Visualization**: Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations, providing insights into global economic trends and comparisons.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Identified trends in GDP per capita over time, using line and scatter plots to analyze country-specific performance.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this workbook, I have:
- Gained proficiency in using **Pandas** for data manipulation, including data cleaning, filtering, and summarization.
- Developed skills in **data visualization** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, creating informative and visually appealing charts.
- Learned how to analyze **GDP per capita** data across multiple countries, understanding global economic patterns.
- Enhanced my ability to **explore datasets** and derive meaningful insights through visualizations and statistical methods.
- Gained hands-on experience in working with **real-world datasets** (e.g., Kaggle) and applying Python libraries to solve data analysis problems.
- Familiarized myself with using **Google Colab**, an online environment for running Python code, which enables seamless sharing and collaboration.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed in your **Google Colab** environment:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

I installed these libraries using pip, if they weren't already installed:
```bash
!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
